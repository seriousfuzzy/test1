# Substrate ERC20 Multi

A Parity Substrate SRML module for multiple ERC20 token management. Any number of tokens can be initialized and managed using this module.

**Important Note:** The Substrate framework and related libraries and APIs are rapidly under development. In case this module does not work with the latest Substrate, apart from submiting an issue in this repo, please try to port the runtime module into a freshly cloned substrate-node-template code. The overall concepts should still be the same but the syntax and setup might change.

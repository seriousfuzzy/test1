# Substrate ERC20 Multi

A Parity Substrate SRML module for multiple ERC20 tokens. Any number of tokens can be initialized and managed using this module.

This module is based on/inspired by the [SRML Assets module](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/assets) but is implemented in a ERC20 flavour.

**Important Note:** The Substrate framework and related libraries and APIs are rapidly under development. In case this module does not work with the latest Substrate build, please submit an issue in this repo, 
You can also try porting the runtime module into a freshly cloned `substrate-node-template` codebase.
